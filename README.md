# WebConf.ca

A website to display web dev conferences in Canada

Built on Foundation.

## Want to help?

This project is meant to be a community effort. Feel free to contribute ways to help improve this site - whether it's to add a conference that we're missing, improve on the design of the site, or any kind of optimization. Either contribute via GitHub, tweet me at <a href="https://twitter.com/heavymetaladam">@heavymetaladam</a> or email me at @ <a href="mailto:adam@adamwills.com">adam@adamwills.com</a>.

Some specifics on how this project could be improved:
* a logo! What's a brand without a logo?
* an easy to use templating system. Rather than editing the html file for each conference (and having to remove old ones), perhaps we could incorporate some js templating?
